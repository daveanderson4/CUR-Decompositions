CUR Matrix Decompositions

Summary:
Reconstruct a data matrix using the CUR decomposition
after a column selection algorithm is performed.
Here, column selection is performed using unweighted
spectral graph sparsification (see Graph-Sparsification)

     Data matrix.  Dimensions: 150-by-150.  The data is
     a Gaussian RBF kernel matrix (with sigma = 0.05)
     of the Iris data set from the UCI Machine Learning
     Repository.  See:

     Identical to r.txt for this example because A is
     symmetric.
